Will attempt to make an encrypted HIPAA compliant Universal Language Translator.
Will use an AI assistant to automatically detect any language being spoken, and translate it to the user's preferred language.
When the user speaks in their preferred language, the AI assitant will translate to the last language that was spoken that was not the preferred language. In this way convesations can be had, with different people speaking many different languages.
